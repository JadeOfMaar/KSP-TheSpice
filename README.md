# The Spice
The most precious substance in the universe has come to KSP. At least as powerful as Karborundum, as rare as Unobtanium, and comes in more than one form and serves a number of roles. Actual sandworms not included but instead there's the ultra-rare Worm Essence. Some certain planet packs are supported, containing planets with better specs for hosting native life forms and the Spice unlike Duna, and when any are present, the spice planet will actually change.

Texture work is currently low in priority for this one, but a fair lot has been done already. What matters is that it's here and it works. See [tasks.md](https://github.com/JadeOfMaar/KSP-TheSpice/blob/master/tasks.md) for version and to-do. This mod is still far from release-ready.
