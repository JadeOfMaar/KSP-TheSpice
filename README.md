# The Spice
The most precious substance in the universe has come to KSP. At least as powerful as Karborundum, as rare as Unobtanium, available in several forms and serves a number of roles, and easy to equip onto a ship and build single stage to anywhere of all sizes. Actual sandworms not included but instead there's the ultra-rare Worm Essence. Some certain planet packs are supported, containing planets with better specs for hosting native life forms and the Spice unlike Duna, and when any are present, the spice planet will actually change.

Texture work is currently in mid-high priority and largely finished. What matters is that it's here and it works. See [tasks.md](https://github.com/JadeOfMaar/KSP-TheSpice/blob/master/tasks.md) for version and to-do. This mod is nearly release-ready.

The science aspect is a large portion, delivering two all-new stock experiments, possibly additions to the results of most of the remaining stock experiments, and 4 additional LDEF (Long Duration Exposure Facility) cartridges to the science mod: MOLE (Mark One Laboratory Extensions, part of Wild Blue Industries by [Angel-125](https://github.com/Angel-125) ), and possible additions to the results of most of the experiments in the DMagic Orbital Science mod.
