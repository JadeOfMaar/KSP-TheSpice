		default = The device fails to operate, or it produces no interesting outputs. 
		DunaSrfLanded = The red sand is revealed to contain molecule chains associated with both culinary seasonings and alien lifeforms. The ample data raises heavy concerns of what lived here, if it became the sand, and if it would be ethical...and safe...to eat this.
		DunaSrfLandedPolarHighlands = The amounts of white sand and organic material in the samples seem to lessen, however slightly, with altitude. Maybe whatever...or whoever created this stuff did not like hiking.
		DunaSrfLandedPoles = The white sand is revealed to contain molecule chains familiar to culinary seasonings and valuable fissile material. It doesn't appear radioactive until ignited by the Sample Kit's lasers which is quite a bonus to workplace safety regulations.
		DunaSrfLandedPolarCraters = The proportion of white sand to typical ices is highest in this part of the arctic. It proves quite safe to handle yet most fitting for use in an engine or a reactor. If this result persists in other Polar Craters then further research into impact force and abundance is in order.

		GratianSrfLanded = The red sand is revealed to contain molecule chains associated with both culinary seasonings and alien lifeforms. The ample data raises heavy concerns of what lived here, if it became the sand, and if it would be ethical...and safe...to eat this.
		GratianSrfLanded = Valuable data pours in as this red sand is processed by the Sample Kit. It seems quite organic and could be degenerate matter from an alien life form. We may be able to convert this into quite a few life-sustaining, even life-enhancing commodities for ourselves!
		GratianSrfLandedPaleoHeights = The noteworthy pink hue in the sand here shows its value. The sample data overflows with references to organic compounds, their sequences, and an overwhelming abundance of typically rare salts.
		GratianSrfLandedSarawakWhite = The white sand is revealed to contain molecule chains familiar to culinary seasonings and valuable fissile material. It doesn't appear radioactive until ignited by the Sample Kit's lasers which is quite a bonus to workplace safety regulations. Much study into this fissile nature is required.
		GratianSrfLandedMuntokWhite = The white sand is revealed to contain molecule chains familiar to culinary seasonings and valuable fissile material. It doesn't appear radioactive until ignited by the Sample Kit's lasers which is quite a bonus to workplace safety regulations. Much study into this fissile nature is required.
		
		DreidosSrfLanded = There seems to be a lot of exotic red sand and a very small amount of white among the yellow normal sand. They are revealed to contain molecule chains associated with both culinary seasonings and alien lifeforms. The ample data raises heavy concerns of what lived here, if it became the sand, and if it would be ethical...and safe...to eat this.
		DreidosSrfLanded = Valuable data pours in as this orange sand is processed by the Sample Kit. It seems quite organic and could be degenerate matter from an alien life form. We may be able to convert this into quite a few life-sustaining, even life-enhancing commodities for ourselves!
		DreidosSrfLandedParchedPeaks = The sand here is more yellow than orange, containing a lot of exotic white sand and very little exotic red sand. It proves quite safe to handle until ignited by the Sample Kit's lasers, which is a good thing, and it seems most fitting for use in an engine or a reactor.
		
		AlvaSrfLanded = The orange sand is revealed to contain molecule chains associated with both culinary seasonings and alien lifeforms. The ample data raises heavy concerns of what lived here, if it became the sand, and if it would be ethical...and safe...to eat this.
		AlvaSrfLanded = Valuable data pours in as this orange sand is processed by the Sample Kit. It seems quite organic and could be degenerate matter from an alien life form. We may be able to convert this into quite a few life-sustaining, even life-enhancing commodities for ourselves!
		AlvaSrfLandedDriedUpRiver = The sand here is more yellow than orange, containing a lot of exotic white sand and much less exotic red sand. It proves quite safe to handle until ignited by the Sample Kit's lasers, which is a good thing, and it seems most fitting for use in an engine or a reactor.
		AlvaSrfLandedSaltPans = There seems to be a small abundance of white sand in this sample. While it proves organic like the red sand, it shows its own distinct qualities. The bias of its abundance here is very clear and warrants further investigation.

	description = The spectral lines of our neighbor planet have the most interesting pattern we've ever witnessed, meaning there is something unknown in its atmosphere. Strangely, the patterns also suggest there is Oxygen so we need to know what effects the codename Spice Gas has on the Kerbal body, and where to draw the line between safe intake levels and gas poisoning. Great rewards tend to ask for a sacrifice so who's brave and crazy enough to step up? ...Except Jebediah.
