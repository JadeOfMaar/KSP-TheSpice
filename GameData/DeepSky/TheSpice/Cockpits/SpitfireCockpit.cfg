	description = An exposed command seat is usually a great thing to have. It can be placed anywhere on any small or large craft. But even with tha luxury, not every pilot wants to feel shock heat or space radiation along with their adrenaline. So we made a really compact cockpit around that seat... With sturdy, space-grade materials, of course.
