# The Spice
The most precious substance in the universe has come to KSP. Texture work is currently barely on the to-do for this one. What matters is that it's here and it works. See [tasks.md](https://github.com/JadeOfMaar/sandbox/blob/master/DeepSky/TheSpice/tasks.md) for version and to-do. This mod is still far from release-ready.
