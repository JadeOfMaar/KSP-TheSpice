	manufacturer = Deep Sky
	description = Deep Sky's engineers attempted to cram more non-engine features into the housing for the Japier engines and make them effectively their own all-in-one system. Unfortunately some complications arose and forced the engineers to cut out the engine features and pack these features inside a few of the hulls. It turned out very well, though. The Japier Spice Tank is, therefore, much more capable as a tank and atmosphere harvester but not an intake.
