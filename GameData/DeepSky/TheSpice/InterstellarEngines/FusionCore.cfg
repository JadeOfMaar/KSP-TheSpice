	description = With the marvel of Spice-Electric conversion, Deep Sky's engineers took a turn away from using radioactive nuclear reactors as we know them to feed the insane needs of things, like a certain 5m ion engine. Our device continues to use a simple laser bombardment technique but to ignite much more White Spice at once. To increase relative efficiency over the small Power Cells, much of its innards actually consist of super-sophisticated thermoelectric converters. The need for radiators on this device is therefore to keep those converters within their operating limits.
