	description = With the marvel of Spice-Electric conversion, Deep Sky's engineers took a turn away from using irradiating nuclear devices and fuels as we know them in order to feed the insane needs of things, like a certain 3.75m plasma engine. Our device contains the necessary ability to produce magnetic containment fields and induce nuclear fusion, and an array of super-advanced thermoelectric converters to bolster electric output. Fully loaded and at full throttle, it can run for 133 days, 2 hours.
